 Overview of My GitHub Repository Structure
 README.md
- Introduction: I offer a brief overview of my project's goals, its relevance, and the specific questions I aim to explore.

- Setup Instructions: I detail the steps required to install R/RStudio, the necessary packages, and how to execute the scripts to replicate my analysis.

- Data Overview: A brief description of the World Bank data utilized, including access instructions.

 Data Organization
- `raw_data/`: This directory houses the untouched data downloaded directly from the World Bank.
- `processed_data/`: Here, I store the data after I've cleaned and transformed it, making it ready for analysis.

 Script Files
- `01_data_download.R`: This script automates the fetching of datasets from the World Bank API.
- `02_data_cleaning.R`: I use this script for the initial data-cleaning steps.
- `03_data_transformation.R`: This script handles transforming the data into the required formats and deriving new, useful variables.
- `04_exploratory_data_analysis.Rmd`: An R Markdown file where I conduct exploratory data analysis, complete with visualizations.
- `05_statistical_analysis.R`: Here, I perform statistical tests and model building.
- `06_results_visualization.Rmd`: Another R Markdown file dedicated to visualizing the results and discussing their implications.
 Output Files
- `figures/`: I save all generated plots and graphs in this directory for easy reference.
- `models/`: This folder is for serialized models that I might use in the future or for validation.
 Additional Documentation
- `codebook.md`: This document provides detailed descriptions of each dataset variable, including any transformations I applied.
- `project_report.Rmd`: A comprehensive R Markdown report that outlines the project from background to conclusion, encapsulating methodology, analysis, results, and my personal interpretations.

 Key Considerations in My Work
In the `README.md`, I aimed for clarity and guidance, making it the gateway to understanding my project's scope and mechanics. My data is meticulously organized to distinguish between its raw and processed states, reinforcing the reproducibility of my analysis.
For the scripts, I adopted a logical numbering and naming convention to reflect each script's role in the analysis pipeline, guiding any fellow researchers through my workflow seamlessly. The outputs directory is neatly categorized to ensure that all visual and model outputs are easily accessible.
In the realm of documentation, I went beyond the basics to include a codebook and a comprehensive project report in R Markdown, aiming to provide a narrative that encompasses my project's journey from conception to conclusion.

 Writing R Scripts and R Markdown Files: My Approach
- Comments: I've commented extensively throughout my code to explain the purpose behind specific code blocks, especially when the operations become complex.
- Descriptive Naming: I chose variable and function names that clearly articulate their purpose and role within my analysis.
- Code Chunking: In my R Markdown files, I've utilized code chunks effectively to segregate different analysis sections, enhancing readability.
- Inline Comments: I've made use of inline comments within my narrative to elucidate why I took certain steps, grounding my analysis in logical reasoning.
